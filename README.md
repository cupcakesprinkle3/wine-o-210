# Wine-O-210

## Motivation
We developed Wine-O-210 to be a gathering place for wine wisdom and wishes. GIVEN I am a wine drinker, I WANT to:
* Track my wine collection, so I can recall which wines I’ve had or would like to have
* Add personal observations, so that I can look back at previous tasting notes and/or notes about a wine I would like to try
* Share my wine collection with others
* See others’ wine collections

## Features
Wine-O-210 is an interactive app that takes user input (a wine entry) and saves it in a database. The application allows users to vote and comment on wine entries. The application also allows users to log in and see their own dashboard of wines they have entered. Wine-O-210 is a nifty way to explore wines from around the world and see and track notes about them.
